# Managed VM Sidecar Containers

These are a set of services that run along side of your [Google App Engine Managed VM](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/managed-vms/) application containers.  Each service runs inside of its own [docker container](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) along with your application's source code.  

These services are automatically provisioned for you when you deploy an application to Managed VMs.
